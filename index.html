    I love to fix things with my 3d printer. Sometimes, my dad will break a small piece to something
    or need a part. It's very handy to be able to model and print a new part. I've also used it to
    make bushings for my <a href="#pen">pen making</a>.

        A few years ago I went hiking with my dad in Bryce canyon and had a blast. It was somewhat cold
        but I thoughly enjoyed it. The picture abov is a picture I took overlooking a part of the trail.

        I've been working this summer on turning pens on my lathe. Here's one of the most interesting ones i've made.
        It features a lower grip of walnut, and a striped esign of pine and walnut above. It is all coates in a layer
        of CA glue to protect it from wear.
